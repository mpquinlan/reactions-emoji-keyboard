- `en` - English ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸
- `pl` - Polish ğŸ‡µğŸ‡±
- `fr` - French ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·
- `it` - Italian ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹

First import lang and use it as `translation` prop.

// ...

translation = { pl }
```

### Customised

There is possibility to pass own translation to library with the prop called `translation` like this

```ts
translation={{
  smileys_emotion: 'Smileys & Emotion',
  people_body: 'People & Body',
  animals_nature: 'Animals & Nature',
  food_drink: 'Food & Drink',
  travel_places: 'Travel & Places',
  activities: 'Activities',
  objects: 'Objects',
  symbols: 'Symbols',

}}
```
